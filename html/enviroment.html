            <h2>BIOL 2160:  Introductory Microbiology
            </h2>
            <br>

            <p>The main objective of this course was to explore life beyond what is visible to the naked eye—microbes! Through this, I gained a deeper understanding of the profound effects these microorganisms have on our world. Dr. Cheeptham also introduced the concept of One Health, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all living beings. This perspective was particularly relevant in understanding how climate change crisis microbial ecosystems, influencing global health, agriculture, and biodiversity.

            <h2>BIOL 2170:  Intro to Ecology
            </h2>
            <br>

            <p>This course provided a foundational understanding of ecological principles, exploring key components such as climate, vegetation, succession, nutrient cycling, and acidification. One of the most impactful experiences was our field trip to Lac Le Jeune, where we observed firsthand how vegetation shifts with elevation and learned about the rain shadow effect shaping Kamloops' landscape. This trip also deepened our understanding of ecological succession, particularly near juniper forests, where we compared post-wildfire regeneration.

            <h2>BIOL 4160:  Principles of conservation biology</h2>
            <br>
            <p>A central theme of this course was the urgency of anthropogenic encroachment into wildlife habitats and the resulting habitat fragmentation. We explored the principles of conservation biology, focusing on the critical need to protect biodiversity. Through discussions of various theories and case studies, we examined the environmental events driving species loss and the importance of preserving ecosystems.</p>

            <h2>GEOG 3070:  Biogeography
            </h2>
            <br>

            <p>
                In this course, I learned about the various theories of biogeography and the emergence of life on Earth. We explored the significance of spatial parameters that allowed life to flourish, examining different ages and how the movement of tectonic plates shaped the distribution of lush vegetation across continents. Understanding these processes deepened my appreciation for how the Earth’s natural systems are interconnected, and how protecting these systems is crucial for environmental sustainability, ensuring the continued health of ecosystems and biodiversity.

            <h2>ENST 3110:  Renewable Energy
            </h2>
            <br>

            <p>
                This was an engaging course that introduced various sources of renewable energy, such as hydropower, geothermal, solar energy etc. I found it fascinating to learn how each of these sources can contribute to a sustainable energy future. We also gained practical skills, such as calculating the number of solar panels needed using an online application, and we explored the different rebates that BC Hydro provides to encourage renewable energy adoption.
